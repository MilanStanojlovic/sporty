# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Design
- Reusable components in shared folder
- Project specific components in components folder
- logic separated from the UI with hooks 
- modules could be introduced as another way of abstraction and easier way of implementing micro frontend architecture
- localstorage used for caching could be improved with indexdb, service workers working with cache or implementing 3rd party solution like react query depending on the desired outcome
